Although we appreciate all vehicle donations, in any condition, running or not, the vast majority of donated vehicles do not qualify to be \"program vehicles\" (provided to a qualified person or entity). Charity Cars bases its decision on many factors including, but not limited to: year, make, model, mileage, condition, location, recipient, repair and funding limitations. Since placing a vehicle with a client is the exception rather than the rule, donors should assume that their vehicle will be sold at auction or for salvage with the proceeds returning to our charity. We will notify the donor by phone and in writing if their vehicle qualifies as a \"program vehicle\" and will be provided to a qualified person or entity."], "Address": ["1052 W State Road 436"], "NE_PER": ["Cars", "-The Wood"], "industries": ["Gasoline_Service_Stations_and_Automotive_Dealers_(Automotive)"], "Zip": ["32714-2939"], "Fax Number": [NaN], "MWE_COMPOUND_NOUN": ["car donation charity", "pre-approval process", "tax deduction", "program cars", "program vehicles", "Car donation charity", "tax receipt", "car donor", "funding limitations", "car donation", "donation program", "tow service", "program vehicle", "car donations", "Charity Cars donation program", "vehicle donation", "vehicle donations", "grocery store", "Tax Deduction", "vehicle donation programs", "station wagon", "national publications", "car dependent society", "fund repairs"]}
